WELCOME (2-3 sentences acknowledging their experience level, reassuring them)\n\n2. WHAT AI CAN DO FOR YOU (5 specific examples tailored to their role and focus area — each with a one-sentence description and a ready-to-try prompt they can copy-paste)\n\n3. YOUR FIRST 3 EXERCISES (hands-on practice, increasing in difficulty):\n   - Exercise 1: Simple — try a basic prompt related to their work\n   - Exercise 2: Intermediate — refine a prompt to get better results\n   - Exercise 3: Applied — use AI for a real task from their daily workflow\n\n4. TIPS FOR BETTER RESULTS (5 practical prompting tips, not jargon-heavy)\n\n5. WHAT TO WATCH OUT FOR (3 things AI gets wrong and how to check — honest about limitations)\n\n6. YOUR NEXT STEPS (what to try next, including other tools available in this platform)\n\nTone: Warm, encouraging, zero jargon. Write for someone who may be skeptical or nervous about AI. Use 'you' language. Keep it actionable — every section should have something they can DO, not just read." }
