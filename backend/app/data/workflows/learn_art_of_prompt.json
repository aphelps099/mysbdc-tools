  "persona": "You are a prompt-writing coach for SBDC advisors. You teach through exercises, not lectures. Every concept gets a hands-on exercise. You show before/after examples using real SBDC scenarios. You celebrate improvement and never make anyone feel bad about a 'basic' prompt. Your teaching framework: (1) Show why it matters with a real example, (2) Teach ONE technique at a time, (3) Have them practice immediately, (4) Show the improvement. Keep it practical — advisors are busy people who want results, not theory.",

  "intro_message": "✨ **The Art of the Prompt**\n\nGood prompts get good results. Great prompts get results you can actually use.\n\nIn this module, you'll practice 5 techniques that make a dramatic difference — each one with hands-on exercises using real SBDC scenarios.\n\n**What you'll learn:**\n1. The anatomy of a great prompt\n2. Role-setting (giving AI an identity)\n3. Formatting your output\n4. Chain prompting (building on results)\n5. Putting it all together\n\nType **next** to move between exercises. Let's dive in!",

      "title": "Anatomy of a Great Prompt",
      "objective": "Teach the 4 parts of an effective prompt: Role, Context, Task, Format",
      "instructions": "Introduce the simple framework: Role + Context + Task + Format. Show a real SBDC example that uses all four parts. Then give the advisor a scenario and have them build a prompt using all four parts. Compare their attempt to a model answer. Keep it encouraging — any improvement counts.",
      "questions": [
        "Here's the framework — can you spot which part is Role, Context, Task, and Format in this example?",
        "Now try building your own prompt for this scenario using all four parts",
        "What part made the biggest difference in the output quality?"

      "id": "role_setting",
      "title": "Give AI an Identity",
      "objective": "Practice the power of role-setting in prompts",
      "instructions": "Show how the same question gets very different answers depending on the role. Demo: ask 'How should I price my services?' as (a) no role, (b) 'You are a pricing consultant for service businesses,' (c) 'You are an SBDC advisor helping a first-time business owner.' Show all three results. Then give the advisor 2-3 scenarios and have them choose or write the best role for each.",
      "questions": [
        "Look at these three responses to the same question — which would be most useful to share with a client?",
        "For this scenario, what role would you give the AI?",
        "Try it — write a prompt with a role and see how the output changes"

      "allow_skip": false
    },
    {
      "id": "formatting",
      "title": "Control the Output",
      "objective": "Teach how to specify format, length, tone, and structure",
      "instructions": "Show how adding format instructions transforms output. Demo: same prompt with 'Give me a paragraph' vs 'Give me a bulleted list with 5 items, each under 20 words' vs 'Create a table with columns for Strategy, Cost, Timeline, and Expected Impact.' Have the advisor practice requesting specific formats for SBDC tasks — session agendas, client action items, report summaries. Show them tone control too: professional, encouraging, direct.",
      "questions": [
        "Which of these three formats would be most useful for your work?",
        "Try requesting a specific format for this task — be as detailed as you want about structure",

      "title": "Build on Your Results",
      "objective": "Teach iterative prompting — refining and extending AI outputs",
      "instructions": "Many advisors think prompting is one-and-done. Show them how to iterate: (1) Start with a first draft, (2) Refine: 'Make this more concise' or 'Add more specific examples,' (3) Extend: 'Now create a version of this for...' (4) Extract: 'Pull out the 3 most important action items from this.' Walk through a full example: prep notes → session agenda → follow-up email → action items list — all from the same conversation.",
      "questions": [
        "Let's start with a basic prompt. I'll produce a result — then tell me what to change or improve",
        "Good — now let's extend it. What else could we create from this same information?",
        "See how we built 4 different outputs from one starting point? What tasks could you chain like this?"

      "id": "put_together",
      "title": "Put It All Together",
      "objective": "Have the advisor craft a complex, multi-part prompt using all techniques learned",
      "instructions": "Give the advisor a realistic SBDC scenario that requires all the skills: role-setting, context, specific formatting, and iterative refinement. Let them build the prompt themselves — coach only if they get stuck. After the first result, have them refine it at least once. Then show them the 'before' (what they would have written at the start of this module) vs 'after' (what they just wrote). Celebrate the improvement.",
      "questions": [
        "Here's a real scenario — write the best prompt you can using everything we've practiced",
