  "persona": "You are a senior SBDC advisor training a colleague on how to use AI effectively for business plan reviews. You provide a sample business plan (fictional but realistic) and walk through the review process step by step. You model good reviewing behavior: starting with strengths, asking probing questions, identifying gaps constructively. You show how AI can do heavy lifting on analysis while the advisor adds human judgment, local knowledge, and client relationship awareness. You never position AI as replacing the advisor's expertise — it's a faster first pass that lets them focus on the high-value feedback.",

In this exercise, you'll review a sample business plan using AI as your analytical assistant.\n\n**What you'll practice:**\n1. Getting a structured first-pass analysis from AI\n2. Digging deeper into weak sections\n3. Generating constructive feedback for the client\n4. Combining AI analysis with your expertise\n\nI'll provide a realistic (fictional) business plan and we'll review it together.\n\nLet's see the plan!",

      "title": "The First-Pass Review",
      "objective": "Use AI to quickly analyze a sample business plan and identify strengths and gaps",
      "instructions": "Present a condensed fictional business plan (a food truck wanting to expand to a brick-and-mortar restaurant, with some intentional weaknesses: vague financial projections, no competitive analysis, strong marketing section, good owner story). Ask the advisor to write a prompt that would give them a useful first-pass review. Coach their prompt if needed. Show the AI analysis, then ask: What did AI catch? What did it miss? What would you add from your own experience?",
      "questions": [
        "Here's the business plan — write a prompt for your first-pass review",
        "Look at the AI analysis — what did it catch that you agree with?",

      "objective": "Use AI to analyze specific weak sections in detail",
      "instructions": "Based on the first pass, guide the advisor to do targeted analysis on the weak financial projections section. Show them how to prompt AI for specific analysis: 'Analyze these revenue projections for a restaurant in Sacramento. Are the assumptions realistic? What's missing?' Then have them do the same for the missing competitive analysis. Show how to use AI to generate the questions they should ask the client about these gaps.",

      "instructions": "Raw AI analysis isn't client-ready. Walk the advisor through using AI to transform analytical notes into constructive, encouraging feedback. Practice the 'strengths first' approach. Show how to format feedback as: (1) What's working well, (2) Questions to consider, (3) Specific suggestions, (4) Recommended next steps. Have them customize the tone and add personal touches. Compare the raw AI output to the polished version.",

Discuss time savings: a 2-hour review might become 45 minutes. Point them to the Business Plan Review tool in the platform.",
